/**
 * Text that is already on the page, and turns on as the reader reaches it.
 *
 * Every word is rendered from the first frame in a near-black that reads as
 * shape but not as language, and wipes to full strength left-to-right, scrubbed
 * against the reader's position. Nothing fades in from nothing and nothing
 * arrives late: the page is complete before it is read, and reading it is what
 * lights it.
 *
 * The mechanic is a two-stop gradient clipped to the glyphs with a single
 * animated stop — see `.wipe-unit` in globals.css. It is done per word rather
 * than per character everywhere except headlines: a headline is thirty units
 * and can afford the finer grain, while a paragraph split to characters is
 * several hundred elements for a difference nobody can see at reading size.
 *
 * Splitting happens during render, not in an effect, so the server emits the
 * finished markup. Splitting on the client would mean the first paint carries
 * unsplit text that is then torn apart, which shows.
